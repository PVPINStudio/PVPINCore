     * This method is used to get a map to store data permanently.<p>
     * The data map is stored in memory and you can use saveToFile to write it into the file.<p>
     * You may also read the data from the file by readFromFile, and the map in memory will be disposed.<p>
     * (The path of the file is automatically generated, in plugins/PVPINCore/data)<p>
     * Each plugin(no matter it's a Java plugin or a JavaScript plugin)
     * can have ONLY ONE data map.<p>
     * The plugin CANNOT access other plugins' data maps.<p>
     * IMPORTANT: Type of the map's keys MUST be String.<p>
     * Type of the map's values MUST be one of the following:<p>
     * 1.Number(Byte, Short, Integer, Long and Double)<p>
     * 2.String<p>
     * 3.Map (whose keys MUST BE strings and values are within the four types)<p>
     * 4.List (values are within the four types)<p>
     * Note that any other number types, like float, etc. will be converted to Double automatically.<p>
     * Note that all elements in one list MUST be of the same type.<p>
     * e.g:<p>
     * [1,2] is valid.<p>
     * [1, "abc"] is invalid.
